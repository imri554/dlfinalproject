# DL Final Project

## Data

LibriSpeech: https://www.openslr.org/12

We recommend downloading the dev-clean and test-clean data sets, since those are smaller in size.

If you extract the data under `data/`, the .gitignore will prevent it from being uploaded.

## Prerequisites

Install Tensorflow and [soundfile](https://pypi.org/project/soundfile/).

## Running

The model's usage is contained in the included Jupyter notebook.
We intend the notebook to be run in Google Colab using a GPU.
If you don't have access to a GPU, shrink the model's parameters.
